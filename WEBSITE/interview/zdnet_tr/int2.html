							<b>　I have described the previous title, Panzer Front, in various media as "a game that tastes like plain udon". In other words, it's a game as simple and plain as plain udon, but with a great base of soup stock. The simpler the game, the better the soup stock, or system, is. I thought this "bis." would be like plain udon with "oage" or tempura on top. I apologize for all the food examples, such as "bean paste" and "plain udon," but I thought it would be something like ....... However, in this interview, I found out that the original direction of the previous work "PANZER FRONT" itself was something like "Tanuki Udon".<br>

							<b>Suzuki</b>　I'd like to ask you about the stories of America, Russia, and Germany that were originally planned for ....... What is the story of the phantom "Russian version"?<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　It's a story about sisters. The older sister is a tank soldier, and the younger sister works in a factory in Leningrad.</font><br>
							<font color="#006633"><b>Yasuhiko Noto</b>　Ohh, really?!</font><br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　That's right (laughs). That's why I even had Mr. Debuchi draw the setting pictures for the characters dressed as construction workers.</font><br>
							<font color="#006633"><b>Yasuhiko Noto</b>　Oh, I see. ...... I didn't know that at all, (laughs).</font><br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　Initially, the story was to depict the "900 Days Siege of Leningrad" from the outside and inside. That's how I thought it would be if I wanted to tell the story. However, when it came time to do it properly, it turned into a very difficult task (laughs).</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　The story of the U.S. version seems to sound very exciting.<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　Well, it's kind of like the movie "Kelly's Heroes" (lol).</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　If the American version was completed first, followed by the Russian and German versions in that order of completeness, what was the reason for the resulting adoption of the German version in "bis."?<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　No, it's because Germany is the most popular country in the world, and if you remove that part, people will think, "What is it"? If it were only America, it would be ...... (laughs). Besides, I had Mr. Debuchi, who has a passion for the stylistic beauty of the German military, draw the characters, so I thought, "I don't think I should drop the German part and make it about another country. That's how we ended up with the German version.</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　Were you almost finished with the American and Russian versions?<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　I think we were getting close. However, when it came to adding CG to the story, we had to do even more of the same work as in the movie. For example, we had to cut the film, and we had to decide how many seconds of text would be inserted. If you do that kind of work, you have to work in a different way from the basic game. However, I didn't want to sacrifice the basic game (tank combat) to do that kind of work. I knew that all of that work would come back to the director.</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　How long was the total show time of the CG movie? <br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　No, not so much. It would only take about 15 minutes in total. </font><br>
							<font color="#006633"><b>Yasuhiko Noto</b>　Besides, that much doesn't fit into the game. If I were to put in more than the current production version, i'd be stuck ....... Initially, we calculated that we could put in three types of stories, but when we decided to put in voice communication messages, the situation changed drastically.</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　If you had tried to include all the story modes for the three countries, you would have ended up with two discs?<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　I guess you could say that. But I don't like the idea of a "two-disc game". I believe that a game should be a single disc. The reason for this is that I'm the kind of person who leaves one game in the console. For months (laughs).</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　Oh, I see (laughs). Let's get back to the story mode, i think the story of the German soldier is the one I feel most comfortable with. Is the story of the German soldier a Jungian story?　I felt a strong Jungian view of the world in that story. ......<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　Huh? Ummm, well, I don't really have a idea (laughs). I don't care about the meaning or mystery of anything. The way games are made nowadays, they are designed to over-serve the user/player. I don't like that very much. I don't really like that. I think it's better if you don't know the meaning, the mystery, or anything at all. So it's made in such a way that you can't trace a specific image. I think Mr. Onoki, who wrote the script, had a different image in mind, but I took it apart and put it together with a completely different interpretation.</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　Oh, you are also involved in the scriptwriting, aren't you, Mr. Ishizu?<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　Yes. Even if it's the same "fight," we had to decide where the battlefield would be, so we did that work. In fact, in the story mode, the scenarios only shows the route that the SS took in reality.<br>
							</font><b>Suzuki</b>　At the end of the game, there is a huge Tiger tank that appears as a boss character.<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　Yes, there was a lot of discussion in the beginning about what it should be. There were various ideas. For example, there was a weird tank ...... that wears a shell-like thing and has wheels on it.</font><br>
							<font color="#006633"><b>Yasuhiko Noto</b>　Oh, the one designed by Leonardo da Vinci?</font><br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　Yes, I had a lot of ideas, such as making a Leonardo da Vinci tank, but I was somewhat foolish ...... and one day i said, "Just use a Tiger tank, it's a tank game".</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　Why did you dare to choose an ally's Tiger tank instead of another country's, lets say, Russia's JS-2 or 3? ......<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　I think there is a problem with using tanks from other countries. In fact, I think it would be better to make them "beat themselves up" to make it more meaningful.</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　Ah. That's how I got it as a "Jungian story", in my case.<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　That's why I went to the trouble of including the time when the Tiger tank is defeated. In that scene, you can see the date on the screen. That's also the time of Hitler's suicide.</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　April 30, 1945...<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　Just after 3 am. That's the time of day. I thought that people who could recognize it, would be able to understand it somehow. It's just for fun, though.</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　What do you think, Mr. Noto?<br>
							<font color="#006633"><b>Yasuhiko Noto</b>　Programmatically, I had a hard time creating the final effect.</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　That shiny, aurora-like .......<br>
							<font color="#006633"><b>Yasuhiko Noto</b>　Yes. In the case of other things, you can get an impression of them by just looking at the film or something, but those things don't exist in reality anymore.</font><br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　I handed over only one simple sketch and said, "Here you go, just do it like this" (laughs). Everyone has already seen that kind of expression in anime and special effects. So I thought, "No matter what you do, it's useless, I'm already tired of seeing it, and I've already done a lot." </font></div>

							<b>　Note: There is a part in the manuscripts and lectures at that time that the Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Gustav Jung "predicted the rise of the Nazis and their subsequent ruin". After World War I, the German people began to cling to the idea that they were superior to other peoples. These are of the same quality as the inferiority complex that comes from the shock and turmoil of defeat, but as a result, we are seeking stronger nations and leaders. Jung explains that it is a sign that the collective unconscious energy of the German people, seeking the German god Wotan (Odin), has begun to move. The story mode of "PANZER FRONT bis.", Which fights against "inner enemies" reminiscent of "Hitler's ghost", happened to remind me of Jung's theory. <br>
							We then moved on to the other major changes in "bis.": "Construction Mode" and "Panzer Front Mode".</b></div>
