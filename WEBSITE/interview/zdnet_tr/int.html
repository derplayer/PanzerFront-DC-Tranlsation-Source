							<b>　At the end of 1999, the tank simulator/shooter "PANZER FRONT" was released simultaneously for PS1 and DC.
							The game, which mainly recreated battlefields and tanks during World War II, was simple and deep enough to be accepted by beginners as well as enthusiasts, and although it was not a "big hit", it was quietly and persistently supported by some players.
							Now a new "PANZER FRONT" title game has been released. The title is "~bis." instead of the usual "~2.
							It is a "revised" version of the previous work, which includes many new features. If the previous work is the "bean jam," what is the batter that surrounds it?
							We talked to the developers about the new elements added to "~bis".<br>

								Director: Yasushi Ishizu<br>

							<b>Suzuki</b>　PANZER FRONT bis." (from now on referred to as "bis.") has a lot of extra features added to the previous game. There are parts like "more maps in Panzer Front Mode" and "you can play on maps made by that person! But first of all, I'd like to talk about the addition of the two new modes, "Construction Mode" and "Story Mode".<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　Hmmm, I don't know where to start ...... (lol).</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　I've heard that there were actually plans to include a story mode in the previous game "Panzer Front". Why didn't it happen?<br>
							<font color="#006633"><b>Yasuhiko Noto</b>　There were a lot of reasons, really a lot (laughs).</font><br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　In addition to the German military version of the story that was included in "bis.", there were also American and Russian military versions of the story that originally existed. I had Mr. Izubuchi (Yutaka Izubuchi, supervisor) prepare the characters for them. In fact, for the American story, we had already completed the graphics for the soldiers. ......</font><br>
							<font color="#006633"><b>Yasuhiko Noto</b>　In the original concept, the stories for the three countries had about 20 maps each. ...... No, they were 30 maps each, and there were 90 maps in total, right?</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　How many stages are there in the German story in "bis."? <br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　Let's see, I think it was just under 20. ......</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　So, in the original concept, there were 30 stories for each of the three countries, Germany, America, and Russia?<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　Yes, there were three main stories in the beginning.</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>Was the story mode originally the main part of the game?<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　Yes. But with a total of 90 scenarios, I couldn't make it. Well, games are made with many people's ideas, so I knew it would be impossible to make a story that would satisfy all the staff. I knew that it would be impossible in many ways. However, my initial goal was still too big. The previous game, "Panzer Front", had a total of 28 levels, including the training aspect, and from that experience, I knew that I would only be able to create the same amount of gameplay this time. Anyway, I knew that it would be an absolute challenge to put together the tank battles. But we really wanted to stick to that point. So we thought, rather than make something half-baked, we try our best and focus only what is doable .......</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　Let me get this straight. It seems that the previous title, PANZER FRONT, itself was different from the original plan, including whether or not it had a story mode.<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　To be honest, we had already planned to include a story mode in the previous game, "Panzer Front". But it didn't make it in due to various reasons. That's why we decided to include it in "bis." This time, we used the concept as a foundation and added some extra elements to the game.</font><br>
							<font color="#006633"><b>Yasuhiko Noto</b>　Also, the CG production company (Sunrise) worked very hard on the film, and we felt that it would be a shame to leave the results in storage.</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　So that means CG for the story mode.<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　As for the movie, when the previous work "PANZER FRONT" was completed, only the CG for the American version of the story was almost finished. For the German version, we were working on all three versions of ...... (US, Germany, and Russia) in parallel, but the German version was still almost finished.<br>
							</font><b>Suzuki</b>　So, the best progress in the CG movie for the story mode was not the German version included in "bis.", but the American version.<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　Yes. I was almost done for the American version. But while I was working on the Russian version, I asked myself, "If I'm going to finish all of this, how long will it take me to finish it? That's what happened. I couldn't wait for the game to be released (laughs). Paradoxically, the last game that I released without a story was the first "PANZER FRONT" that I had in my head. ...... (laughs).<br>
							</font><b>Suzuki</b>　The story part, which was included to give the game a "general gameplay" feel, was cut due to the difficulty of the movie part, which allowed us to focus purely on the part that "Yasushi Ishizu" wanted to create.<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　That's right. At the beginning of the planning stage, we were trying to get a very famous manga artist to draw the characters, and although I don't know the details of the process, we actually asked him to do it. I don't know the details of the process, but I even asked him to do it, only to find out that he refused in the end (laughs). If that had gone through, PANZER FRONT would probably have turned out to be a completely different game. However, due to a variety of other reasons, I lost all of these aspects of the game, and the previous game was made as I wanted it to be (in the form I had originally planned) on ....... (laughs). Well, if you look at it from a different perspective, "I want to add various elements to the game" is also true in a sense.</font><br>
							<b>Suzuki</b>　In the actual process of creating PANZER FRONT, there was quite a struggle between the "unabashed realism" and the "game-like approach" that was reflected in the final product. ......?<br>
							<font color="#000099"><b>Yasushi Ishizu</b>　It's been a long time coming (laughs). From the beginning to the end, it was an endless cycle of discussion, trial and error. Well, little by little, we gradually converged on what had taken shape in the previous work ...... as we worked on it.</font><br>
