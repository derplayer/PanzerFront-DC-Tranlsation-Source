[Updates 1.2]

1) Added two new batches to truncate & pad images.

[Updates 1.1]

1) Changed ASCII Splash screen, to use - instead of Ä.

2) Made the Extract batch create the extracted folder & then extract the IP.BIN along with the rest of the files.
(a one liner)

3) Changed the batches to use %~NX1 so folders with "." will be handled correctly.
(None of my games folder have "." as there all named after each game name)

4) Other minor changes, code revisions.
